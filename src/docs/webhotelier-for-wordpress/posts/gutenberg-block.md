## Gutenberg Block
With the Gutenberg editor you can insert the WebHotelier Form as a block.

Find the block inside the **Widgets** subcategory; it is named **WebHotelier
Form** (or similar). The block exposes the same options as the shortcode and
widget (URL, max values, orientation, dates, CSS classes). Changes made in the
block sidebar are applied live in the editor.

This provides a convenient, visual way to place forms inside posts and pages
without using shortcodes.
