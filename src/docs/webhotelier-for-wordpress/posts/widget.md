## Widget
You can add the WebHotelier Availability Form as a widget via **Appearance →
Widgets** in WordPress.

Select **WebHotelier Booking Form** from the available widgets and place it in
any widget area (sidebar, footer, etc.). Each widget instance supports the
same options available to the shortcode (URL, max rooms, max adults, nights,
orientation, custom CSS class, etc.) and optionally a title.

Best practice

- Use `vertical` orientation for sidebars and narrow containers.
- The widget supports all shortcode attributes so you can customize behaviour
	per-instance.
